# GDS Service Standard

## Introduction

The [Government Digital Service (GDS) Service Standard][2] sets out what teams must do to build and run effective, user-centred digital services. It helps ensure services are accessible, secure and meet user needs.

All teams **MUST** align with the Service Standard when building or operating digital services. This includes internal tools, public-facing services and data platforms. The standard applies throughout the service lifecycle — from discovery to live operation.

## Guidance

### Applying the standard

Teams are expected to embed the Service Standard into their delivery approach from the outset. To do this effectively, teams **MUST**:

- review the 14 points of the Service Standard and understand how they apply to their service
- embed the standard into delivery practices from the outset
- ensure they align through all stages: Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live and Retirement

In addition, teams **SHOULD**:

- map each point of the Service Standard to relevant team activities, artefacts or controls
- use it to guide architectural, design and delivery decisions
- review alignment regularly as the service evolves
- use the [GDS service manual][1] as a reference for good practice

### Service assessments

Some services may be subject to formal [GDS assessments][4]. These assessments help ensure that services meet the Service Standard before progressing to the next phase.

Teams **MUST**:

- engage with the assessment process early
- maintain evidence of how the service meets each point of the Service Standard
- address any recommendations or actions from assessors

Services that are not formally assessed **MUST** still use the Service Standard as a benchmark for quality and user-centred design.

## Roles and responsibilities

Clear roles help ensure that the standard is applied consistently and that teams are prepared for assessments.

- **Delivery teams** — responsible for understanding and applying the standard in day-to-day work
- **Product managers** — responsible for ensuring the service meets user needs and aligns with the standard
- **Service owners** — accountable for overall compliance with the standard and for engaging with assessments
- **Architects and designers** — responsible for ensuring technical and design decisions support the standard

## Measurement

The following indicators help assess how well teams are aligning with the [GDS Service Standard][2]:

| ID    | Indicator                       | Green                                      | Amber                                  | Red                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| GDS-1 | Standard understood and applied | All 14 points mapped to delivery practices | Some points addressed                  | No evidence of alignment           |
| GDS-2 | Evidence maintained             | Evidence available for each point          | Partial or outdated evidence           | No evidence maintained             |
| GDS-3 | Assessment readiness            | Team prepared and engaged early            | Late engagement or gaps in preparation | Not prepared or unaware of process |
| GDS-4 | Continuous alignment            | Standard reviewed and updated regularly    | Reviewed occasionally                  | Not reviewed after initial phase   |
