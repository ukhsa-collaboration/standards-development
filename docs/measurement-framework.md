# Measurement Framework

To ensure consistent and measurable adoption of engineering practices across UKHSA digital services, this framework defines a set of indicators for each security principle. These indicators help teams assess their current maturity, identify areas for improvement, and demonstrate progress over time.

Each indicator is accompanied by example outcomes that describe what **Achieved (GREEN)**, **Partially Achieved (AMBER)**, and **Not Achieved (RED)** look like in practice. This enables teams to self-assess in a structured and repeatable way, and supports engineering leadership in tracking security posture across the organisation.

The indicators are semantically numbered by principle (e.g. `SP-1`, `SDLC-2`) to support traceability and integration into dashboards, audits, and continuous improvement initiatives.
