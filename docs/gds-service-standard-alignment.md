# GDS service standard alignment

## Introduction

The [Government Digital Service (GDS) Service Standard][1] sets out what teams must do to build and run effective, user-centred digital services. It helps ensure services are accessible, secure and meet user needs.

All teams **MUST** align with the [GDS Service Standard][1] when building or operating digital services. This includes internal tools, public-facing services and data platforms. The standard applies throughout the service lifecycle — from discovery to live operation.

## Guidance

### Applying the standard

Teams are expected to embed the [GDS Service Standard][1] into their delivery approach from the outset. To do this effectively, teams **MUST**:

- review the 14 points of the [GDS Service Standard][1] and understand how they apply to their service
- embed the standard into delivery practices from the outset
- ensure alignment is maintained through all phases: discovery, alpha, beta, live and retirement
- prepare for service assessments where required

In addition, teams **SHOULD**:

- map each point of the standard to relevant team activities, artefacts or controls
- use the standard to guide architectural, design and delivery decisions
- review alignment regularly as the service evolves
- use the [GDS service manual][2] as a reference for good practice

### Service assessments

Some services may be subject to formal [GDS assessments][3]. These assessments help ensure that services meet the standard before progressing to the next phase.

Teams **MUST**:

- engage with the assessment process early
- maintain evidence of how the service meets each point of the standard
- address any recommendations or actions from assessors

Services that are not formally assessed **SHOULD** still use the standard as a benchmark for quality and user-centred design.

## Roles and responsibilities

Clear roles help ensure that the standard is applied consistently and that teams are prepared for assessments.

- **Delivery teams** — responsible for understanding and applying the standard in day-to-day work
- **Product managers** — responsible for ensuring the service meets user needs and aligns with the standard
- **Service owners** — accountable for overall compliance with the standard and for engaging with assessments
- **Architects and designers** — responsible for ensuring technical and design decisions support the standard

## Measurement

The following indicators help assess how well teams are aligning with the [GDS Service Standard][1]:

| ID | Indicator | GREEN | AMBER | RED |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| GDS-1 | Standard understood and applied | All 14 points mapped to delivery practices | Some points addressed | No evidence of alignment |
| GDS-2 | Evidence maintained | Evidence available for each point | Partial or outdated evidence | No evidence maintained |
| GDS-3 | Assessment readiness | Team prepared and engaged early | Late engagement or gaps in preparation | Not prepared or unaware of process |
| GDS-4 | Continuous alignment | Standard reviewed and updated regularly | Reviewed occasionally | Not reviewed after initial phase |
