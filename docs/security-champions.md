# Security champions

## Introduction

Security champions are embedded advocates who help integrate secure practices into day-to-day delivery. Acting as a bridge between engineering and security teams, they promote awareness, support early risk identification, and help ensure that security is considered throughout the software delivery lifecycle.

Security champions are not expected to be security experts, but they **SHOULD** have a strong interest in secure development and be supported with training and guidance.

## Guidance

Teams **MUST**:

- nominate at least one security champion per delivery team
- ensure champions act as a liaison between delivery and security functions
- support champions with time and access to relevant training

Champions **SHOULD**:

- participate in threat modelling, architecture reviews and incident response
- contribute to security awareness and knowledge sharing within their team
- attend regular security syncs or communities of practice

Champions **MAY**:

- help review security tooling and processes
- contribute to secure coding standards and documentation

## Measurement
