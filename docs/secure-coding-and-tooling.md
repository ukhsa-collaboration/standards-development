# Secure coding and tooling

## Introduction

Secure coding and automated tooling help teams build software that is safe, reliable and maintainable. By detecting issues early in the development process, teams can reduce the cost of remediation and improve delivery confidence.

This guidance sets out the minimum expectations for secure coding practices and the use of automated tools in engineering teams.

## Guidance

Teams **MUST**:

- use static analysis tools to detect code quality and security issues before merging code
- prevent secrets from being committed to source control
- perform Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify supply chain risks
- enforce security checks in CI/CD pipelines for all branches

Teams **SHOULD**:

- use tools such as [SonarCloud][1], [Snyk][2], [CodeQL][5], and [detect-secrets][3] to automate scanning
- keep CI/CD jobs short and isolated to reduce feedback time
- run long-running scans asynchronously if they impact pipeline performance

Teams **MUST NOT**:

- merge code that fails static analysis or contains unresolved security issues
- store credentials, tokens or other secrets in source control

## Recommended tools

The tools listed below help teams automate secure coding practices and reduce manual effort. They support early detection of issues, improve consistency across projects, and integrate easily into CI/CD workflows.

Teams **SHOULD** choose tools that suit their technology stack and delivery context, and **MUST** ensure they are properly configured and maintained.

| Area                  | Tool                | Purpose                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Code quality          | [SonarQube][1]      | Detects bugs, code smells and vulnerabilities                      |
| Dependency management | [Dependabot][4]     | Automates updates to vulnerable dependencies                       |
| Secrets detection     | [detect-secrets][3] | Prevents secrets from being committed                              |
| Security scanning     | [CodeQL][5]         | Performs semantic code analysis to detect security vulnerabilities |
| Security scanning     | [Snyk][2]           | Identifies known vulnerabilities in dependencies                   |

## Measurement

Use these indicators to assess adoption and effectiveness of secure coding and tooling practices.

| ID    | Indicator                | Green                                                               | Amber                                                       | Red                                          |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| SCT-1 | Static analysis in CI/CD | Enforced on **all branches** with blocking checks                   | Enforced on **main** branch only                            | Not enforced or bypassable                   |
| SCT-2 | SCA reports reviewed     | Reviewed **regularly** with actions tracked in backlog              | Reviewed **occasionally** or inconsistently                 | Not reviewed or no evidence                  |
| SCT-3 | Secrets management       | No secrets in source control; scanning tools in place and effective | Secrets removed after detection; no scanning tools in place | Secrets present in code or committed by team |
| SCT-4 | Tooling coverage         | All relevant tools integrated and actively used in CI/CD            | Some tools integrated or used manually                      | No tooling or ad hoc usage                   |
| SCT-5 | Developer awareness      | All developers trained on secure coding and tooling practices       | Some developers trained or training outdated                | No training or awareness activity            |
