# Measuring security maturity

## Introduction

Measuring security maturity helps teams understand their current security posture and identify areas for improvement. Regular assessments support continuous improvement and help prioritise investment in training, tooling and secure development practices.

## Guidance

Teams **MUST**:

- complete a security self-assessment every quarter
- use the [NIST SSDF][1], [NCSC CAF][2], and [MVSP][3] frameworks to assess their maturity
- record a RAG status for each relevant standard or control
- track changes over time to identify trends and inform decisions

Assessment results **MAY** be used to:

- identify training needs
- prioritise security tooling or automation
- guide process improvements

## Measurement
