# UKHSA Development Standards

Welcome to the UKHSA Development Standards repository. It contains guidelines and best practices for engineering teams who are designing, building, and maintaining software at UKHSA.

## :construction: Work in progress :rotating_light:

The content here is a work in progress. We are publishing it early to foster collaboration and encourage feedback.

We are currently on our second draft of the guidance. We expect at least two more before we reach v1.

## Scope and audience

These standards apply to all engineering teams involved in building and operating software at UKHSA. They cover the full software delivery lifecycle, from planning and design through to deployment, monitoring and decommissioning.

The guidance is intended to support teams in meeting the expectations of architecture, security and governance functions by embedding good practice into day-to-day delivery.

Intended audience:

- Software engineers and developers
- Engineering leads and delivery teams
- People involved in designing, building or operating software systems

## How to read the guidelines

The following terms are used throughout this guidance to indicate the strength of each requirement. These are adapted from [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and contextualised for UKHSA:

- **MUST**: This requirement is mandatory. It applies universally and must be followed without exception unless formally approved.
- **MUST NOT**: This action is explicitly prohibited. It must not be taken under any circumstances unless an approved exception is in place.
- **SHOULD**: This is a strong recommendation. There may be valid reasons to deviate, but the implications must be understood, justified and documented.
- **SHOULD NOT**: This is a strong recommendation against a practice. Exceptions may exist, but they must be carefully considered, justified and documented.
- **MAY**: This is an optional practice or recommendation. Teams may choose to adopt it based on context, value or preference.

## Using these guidelines

Each section of this site addresses a specific aspect of software development, including security, environments, quality assurance and measurement. Teams are expected to apply these standards consistently, and to document any exceptions with appropriate justification.
